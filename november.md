## Elizabeth Drew Stoddard

Much have I spoken of the faded leaf;	 Long have I listened to the wailing wind,	 And watched it ploughing through the heavy clouds,	 For autumn charms my melancholy mind.	 

When autumn comes, the poets sing a dirge: The year must perish; all the flowers are dead;	 The sheaves are gathered; and the mottled quail	 Runs in the stubble, but the lark has fled!	 

Still, autumn ushers in the Christmas cheer,	 The holly-berries and the ivy-tree: They weave a chaplet for the Old Year’s bier,	 These waiting mourners do not sing for me!	 

I find sweet peace in depths of autumn woods,	 Where grow the ragged ferns and roughened moss;	 The naked, silent trees have taught me this,— The loss of beauty is not always loss!
